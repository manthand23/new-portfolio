                  <p>
                    Currently, I'm a <span className="text-primary font-semibold">Software Engineering Resident at Headstarter</span>, where I design scalable full-stack and AI pipelines. My recent work involves building multiple machine learning and web applications using Python, C++, and TypeScript, optimizing for speed, modularity, and real-world deployment. I've led the design of multithreaded systems using POSIX and Docker-based CI/CD pipelines to support large-scale LLM tasks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Previously, I was a <span className="text-primary font-semibold">Software Engineering Intern at RadicalAI</span>, where I developed a React-based frontend and Node.js backend for an AI chatbot that increased engagement by 40%. I also contributed to Kai, an open-source AI Teaching Assistant, and built internal tools with C++ for high-performance use cases.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Across my roles‚Äîincluding at <span className="text-lavender font-semibold">ScaleAI</span>, where I wrote thread-safe daemons and refactored data infrastructure‚ÄîI've learned to ship production-ready code across diverse stacks and collaborate in fast-paced Agile environments. I bring a strong foundation in Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, C++, React.js, Node.js, and cloud platforms like AWS and GCP.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I'm open to opportunities in AI or full-stack engineering, especially in teams where I can continue learning, contribute to cutting-edge projects, and solve tough technical problems. Let's connect!
